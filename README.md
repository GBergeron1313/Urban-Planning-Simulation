An advanced urban development simulator that lets urban planners and city
developers test infrastructure changes, population dynamics, and
environmental impacts in a real-time 3D environment.  
Core Components  
1. SimCore (Main System)  
● Controls the main simulation loop  
● Manages save/load operations  
● Coordinates between other systems  
● Handles basic time controls (play/pause)  
2. Population System  
● Manages up to 100 citizens  
● Controls basic behaviors (home/work cycles)  
● Handles simple pathfinding  
● Tracks basic needs (housing, jobs)  
3. City Grid  
● Maintains a 5x5 mile city grid  
● Handles three zone types  
● Controls basic building placement  
● Manages land usage  
4. Basic Analytics  
● Tracks essential city statistics  
● Generates simple reports
